## Frankie Shaw

I am a full stack junior web developer, proficient in Javascript, Ruby, Test Driven Development, Object Orientated Design and both front-end and back-end development. I recently graduated from Makers Academy. I chose not to go to university and to instead focus on something in which both I have a genuine interest and could see myself doing for the rest of my life. From learning the basics to my final project, I've enjoyed programming more than any other work. Software development has given me the opportunity no other has to be creative and to see my work as useful and important in the world.
I am looking for a job where the work and my co-workers will help expand my knowledge while successfully delivering value for my employer and their clients. I think it is very important to be in a workspace where I would be given clear instructions on what is needed from me while also having the freedom to choose how I reach those goals. As a junior developer, I value the understanding employers have that, while I may not know everything right now, I am more than willing to find out!

## Skills

I am a fast learner, I am never stuck on a bug for long, and I approach everything I do from a logical perspective trying to stay as rational as possible. I never let hard work bring me down and I stay positive, confident and (most importantly) happy!

#### Group Work

One of my favourite things about Makers Academy is that I met so many people that I otherwise would not have. Out of all my work, I am the most proud of my group work. Turning a simple idea into user stories and acceptance criteria, along with AGILE team work has helped me be more efficient and focused in groups, and furthered my desire to just keep coding! Group Projects: [Makersbnb](https://github.com/frankiefy/Makersbnb) , [DevLinQ](https://github.com/pedrocastanheira77/devlinq) , [Steami](https://github.com/bvjones/Steami)

#### Problem Solver

My ability to convert seemingly big challenges into smaller tasks that are well defined and achievable has greatly improved my organisation and efficiency when working on projects at Makers Academy. When handling smaller problems, such as errors and bugs, I aim to employ the best possible debugging processes. It's due to this I have been able to push the boundaries of how far I can go into the unknown with my work and still come out the other side with a great result! Eg. [DevLinQ chrome extension](https://github.com/pedrocastanheira77/devlinq)

#### Fast Learner

As a junior developer I believe the speed at which I learn new skills is important. One of my proudest achievements at Makers Academy was to learn Javascript, Jquery, Jasmine, AJAX and APIs for a project and build it in only 5 days: [Thermostat](https://github.com/frankiefy/Thermo). I have become a faster learner due to Makers Academy teaching me to be a knowledge worker; to know how to find the answer quickly and precisely with no starting information.
